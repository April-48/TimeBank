# 💰 TimeBank TC Pricing Guide (No Negotiation | Fixed Pricing)

## 🎯 Core Principles

### **No Negotiation** ✅
- Fixed price at publication, providers can only "accept/decline"
- Avoids price disputes and time waste

### **Price Transparency** ✅
- TC amounts are public, no hidden fees

### **No Platform Commission** ✅
- Platform doesn't charge commission (payment gateway/network fees may apply, charged as incurred or paid by requester)

## 📊 Pricing Method (Only 1 Type Available)

### **Fixed Pricing (Recommended)** ✅
- Single payment amount: Escrow → Delivery → Release
- *Note: Milestone-based pricing not available*

## 💡 Recommended Price (Automatically Provided on Publish Page)

- Displays **recommended range (P25–P75)** and **suggested price (P50/median)**, labeled with **confidence level (Low/Mid/High)**
- Price calculated by system based on task type, skills, complexity, and historical data. Requester can "apply with one click"

## 🛡️ Price Floor

- Each task category has a **minimum publish price**. Below floor price cannot be published; below P25 will show "expected low acceptance rate" warning

## 🎯 Best Practices

- **Simple Tasks**: 20–50 TC
- **Standard Tasks**: 50–150 TC  
- **Complex Tasks**: 150–500 TC
- **Urgent Tasks** may have premium pricing (e.g., ×1.2)

## ❓ FAQ: Recommendation Confidence

- With limited samples, uses "price table prior + small sample shrinkage", outputs more conservative and labeled "Low Confidence"
- As data accumulates, automatically adjusts closer to market rates
